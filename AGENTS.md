# AGENTS.md — Operating Rules for Coding Agents

> **Audience:** Any LLM-based coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build, Hermes subagents, etc.) working in this repository on behalf of `halaprix`. Read this first; treat it as binding.

---

## 1. Project Context

**LeakWatch** is a battery-monitoring companion app for **Huawei smartwatches** (HarmonyOS / HarmonyOS NEXT) and **Huawei phones with HMS** (no GMS). It samples `batteryInfo` on the watch, pushes data over **HMS Wear Engine**, and visualises drain rates on the phone.

The project's hard constraint is **battery-frugality of the monitor itself** — a battery app that drains the battery is self-defeating. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the hard-mode sampling rules (120s interval, 10-min batched flush, listener-driven not polled).

---

## 2. Ground Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 2.1 Privacy & Disclosure

This is a **public, build-in-public** repository under the `halaprix` organisation. Marian explicitly opts into public development.

**Allowed in commits, issues, PRs, comments, releases:**

- Project name (`LeakWatch`), repo name (`halaprix/leakwatch`)
- Public dependency names and versions
- Generic stack mentions (e.g. "we use HMS Wear Engine 5.0.0.300")
- High-level architecture diagrams and code snippets
- Issues with public Huawei Developer Forum links

**PROHIBITED — must never be disclosed in any artifact (including issues, PR comments, commits, release notes, generated docs):**

- Internal/private IP addresses (e.g. `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16-31.x.x`)
- Filesystem paths under `/home/pkl/...` or any other user's home
- API keys, tokens, signing certificates, `agconnect-services.json` contents, fingerprints
- Huawei AppGallery Connect project IDs, package names bound to Marian's personal AGC account (use placeholder `com.halaprix.leakwatch` only in committed `build-profile.json5` if confirmed, otherwise leave as TODO)
- Home Assistant entities, devices, or any other smart-home internal state
- Names of other `halaprix/*` private repos unless they are already public
- Any reference to Marian's personal infrastructure (PC hostname, RTX 5070 Ti, etc.)
- Tailscale hostnames (e.g. `*.ts.net`)
- Machine IDs (e.g. `/etc/machine-id` content)
- Huawei AGC fingerprints (base64-encoded fingerprints from Wear Engine Kit console)

**Rule of thumb:** if a fact would be useful to an attacker profiling Marian's home lab, it's not in this repo. Keep the public surface narrow.

### 2.2 No Payments / No Smart-Home Side Effects

- **Never** invoke payment flows, payment SDKs, or any code that touches money.
- **Never** read or write Home Assistant state from this project. It is a battery monitor, not a smart-home controller. If integration with HA seems attractive, it belongs in a separate repo.
- **Never** commit credentials, even "test" ones. Use environment variables and `.env.example` only.

### 2.3 Git Workflow

- **One logical change per commit.** Do not batch unrelated fixes.
- **Conventional Commits** are mandatory. Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`
  - Example: `feat(watch): sample batterySOC at 120s interval`
- **Commit body** must reference the issue or design doc it implements when one exists.
- **Push after every commit.** Do not accumulate local commits — Marian reads diffs, not the working tree.
- **Never force-push to `main`.** Branches may be rebased; `main` is sacred.
- **Commit author:** the configured git identity, not a co-authored-by LLM line. Marian owns all commits.

### 2.4 Semantic Versioning

- This project follows [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). Tags: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, prefixed with `v`.
- `MAJOR`: breaking API or data-format change.
- `MINOR`: backwards-compatible feature.
- `PATCH`: backwards-compatible bugfix.
- Pre-release: `v0.1.0-alpha.1`, `v0.1.0-beta.1`, `v1.0.0-rc.1`.
- **Until `v1.0.0` is released, breaking changes are allowed in `MINOR` bumps** (pre-1.0 SemVer convention).

### 2.5 Code Review

All non-trivial changes must be reviewed by **at least one** of:

- A second human reviewer, OR
- A different LLM agent from the approved set (Claude, Codex, Grok Build)

If a coding agent writes a feature, the same agent must not be the sole reviewer of its own output. Either Marian reviews, or a different agent does.

### 2.6 Build-in-Public Etiquette

- The README, issue templates, and PR template are the public face. Keep them sharp.
- Screenshot and demo paths in markdown should be relative (`./docs/screenshots/...`) — no absolute paths.
- If a feature is intentionally undocumented in public (e.g. a private build flag), say so in the code comment and do not mention it in public docs.
- **Update docs on every relevant change.** If a commit adds, removes, or changes behaviour visible to users or contributors, update the corresponding doc file (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/*.md`) in the same PR — docs are not a separate cleanup step. When in doubt, update.

This layout is **target state**. Subdirectories `watch/`, `phone/`, `tools/` are created lazily as their content lands. Do not pre-create empty dirs.

## 4. Coding Agent Specifics

### 4.1 Tooling Expectations

- **Read this file** (`AGENTS.md`) and `README.md` before any action. If you cannot read both, say so and stop.
- **Check `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** for hard-mode sampling rules before touching `batteryInfo` code paths.
- **Use `execute_code` or `terminal`** for filesystem work, not `cat` / `sed` / `awk` (Hermes convention).
- **Verify with real tool output.** Do not claim a file was written without `read_file`-ing it back. Do not claim a build passed without its exit code.

### 4.2 Subagent Discipline

- **Subagent cap = 600s.** If a subagent is still running at 600s, kill it and resume inline.
- **Multi-file refactors** with delegation: expect 10–20% leftover. Finish inline; do not re-dispatch the same task.
- **Do not poll.** Either the user is waiting (foreground) or you backgrounded with `notify_on_complete=true`. Do not `process(action='poll')` in a tight loop.
- **No "ready to push when you are" prompts.** Push when done. Marian hates that pattern.

### 4.3 Forbidden Patterns

- ❌ Inventing APIs, version numbers, or repo URLs that do not exist. If you don't know, say "I need to verify this" and use a search tool.
- ❌ Fabricating test output, build logs, or screenshots.
- ❌ Committing `.env`, `*.jks`, `*.keystore`, `agconnect-services.json`, or any `local.properties` content.
- ❌ Suggesting Home Assistant integration in any PR description.
- ❌ Lying about what changed in a PR. The diff is the source of truth.

### 4.4 Recommended Patterns

- ✅ Read the failing test before fixing it.
- ✅ Use the `skills/` system when one matches the task. Skills are procedural memory.
- ✅ Save a non-trivial workflow as a skill after you finish it.
- ✅ When in doubt, ask. The cost of one clarifying question is lower than the cost of a wrong implementation.

---

## 5. Communication Style

- **Direct, no fluff.** Marian runs ADHD-friendly. Short sentences, bullet points, action items.
- **Markdown always.** Tables for comparisons, code blocks for code, lists for steps. Telegram renders it natively.
- **Polish / English mix OK in chat.** Repository artifacts (commits, docs, code comments) are **English only** unless explicitly localised.

---

## 6. Licensing

Default license for this project is **Apache License 2.0**, consistent with `HMS-Wearable-Example` (the Kotlin reference implementation we forked patterns from). If a contributor wants a different license, raise it in an issue first; do not change `LICENSE` unilaterally.

## 7. Change Log for this File

| Date | Change | Author |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-16 | Initial bootstrap | halaprix |

Substantive changes to `AGENTS.md` require a PR review by Marian. LLM agents: if you think a rule is wrong, propose a change in an issue; do not silently edit the rulebook.

<!-- BEGIN BEADS INTEGRATION v:1 profile:minimal hash:7510c1e2 -->
## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
